# Trial
This is my first project. It is a really basic grading management system with the abiliy to load a bunch of students from a file, which includes their names, ID numbers, and GPA. The functionality is displaying all students, adding, getting student by position, removing by position and replacing a student. I implemented this program using the linked list. The file gets updated as soon as you exit out of the program.

The menu:

        ########## Student Record Management ##########

                1.    Display all students
        
                2.    Add student
        
                3.    Get student by postion
        
                4.    Replace student
        
                5.    Remove student
        
                6.    Exit

The user then enter their choice using numbers from 1 to 6. Then each of these options have different ways of operating.
